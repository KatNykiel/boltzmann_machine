    "\n",
    "The Ising Model is a mathematical model used to describe ferromagnetism. This model describes a lattice of spins, which can have either +1 or -1 states. An example of such a system is given below\n",

    "**Why is the Ising model useful?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ising model provides a simplified view of ferromagnetism, which can be used to explain phase transitions between *ordered*, magnetic states and *disordered* states \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the energy function associated with the Ising model is identical to the form used in Boltzmann machines, a neural network often used in recommendation engines\n",
