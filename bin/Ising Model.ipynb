    "**What is the Ising model?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ising Model is a mathematical model used to describe ferromagnetism. This model describes a lattice of spins, which can have either +1 or -1 states. An example of such a system is given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./ising_small.png \"Representation of the Ising model\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy of such a system is the sum of interactions between neighboring spins (assuming $\\vec{B}=0$)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H = -\\sum_{\\langle i,j\\rangle}J\\sigma_i\\sigma_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $J$ is the interaction energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For ferromagnetic systems, $J>0$, and the lowest energy configuration is parallel spins with non-zero magnetic moment.\n",
    "<img src=\"./parallel.png\" alt=\"parallel\" width=\"280\">\n",
    "- For antiferromagnetic systems, $J<0$ and the lowest energy configuration is anti-parallel spins with zero magnetic moment.\n",
    "<img src=\"./anti_parallel.png\" alt=\"parallel\" width=\"280\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is the Ising model useful?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ising model provides a simplified view of ferromagnetism, which can be used to explain phase transitions between *ordered*, magnetic states and *disordered* states.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the energy function associated with the Ising model is identical to the form used in Boltzmann machines, a neural network often used in recommendation engines.\n",

    "## Solving the 2D Ising Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical mechanics (a field of physics) provides a way to solve the Ising model. At a given temperature, the Boltzmann distribution describes the probability of any given configuration in terms of its energy. Thus, finding the equilibrium state of the Ising model at temperature T requires sampling this distribution and calculating average properties, like magnetic moment or energy. Below, we show how this problem can be solved using a [brute force approach](Brute%20Force%20Ising%20Model.ipynb) (spoiler alert: this does not work) and a [Monte Carlo approach](Monte%20Carlo%20Ising%20Model.ipynb) proposed by Nicholas Metropolis and Stanislaw Ulam in 1949.[1] *Interesting fact: Arianna Rosenbluth is credited with writing the code used in the paper.*[2,3]\n",
